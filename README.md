# This Is A Clever Blog Name

For this assignment, I had to create a functional blog


## The Making Of


This assignment required a blog with two main pages- a home page where you could input information, and a blog page where you could view said information.
The home page needed to have inputs for a user to enter information, and it needed to be connected to a JavaScript file to hold that info in localStorage.
On top of that, it also needed to be formatted using CSS so it didn't look completely hideous.

The second page needed to be able to import the info from localStorage to be displayed, without deleting already-existing info.
It also needed to toggle between light mode and dark mode, and have a footer with certain pieces of information in it.

I have done all of this, creating the amazing blog "This Is A Clever Blog Name," where I have taken all of the necessary pieces and put them together.
For the JavaScript files, not only did I make one commit information to localStorage, but it also throws off various messages depending on what is done.
I also attached an event listener to that file so that the "submit" button would work.
For the other JavaScript file, I attached event listeners to two buttons, one to toggle dark mode on and off, the other to return to the first HTML page.
I also created a complex web of code for the toggle button so that multiple pieces of the page would change with light/dark mode.
On top of that, I made that file import information from localStorage to display on the connected HTML file.
